                    I thought I'd make you a website to flex my nerd skills (which I totally didnâ€™t forget and had to refresh constantly), and this is gonna
                    be a long ass thing divided into multiple parts, so please just bear with me. btw this DOES look better on desktop not mobile

                <p>Dear Diary; A Letter for My Best Friend. <br>Man i have met you almost four years ago by now and you STILL manage to impress me - 
                    mostly with your creativity and humour of course. I can't imagine what my life would
                    look like if i hadn't met you; probably it would be grey and sad and allat. You've made me
                    so many different memories and connections with people, i cant even put words on how grateful i am to have a friend like you.
                    You met me at a very strange time in my life (FIGHT CLUB REFERENCE??) yet somehow you've only made it
                    stranger, in the best way possible of course. Through my ups and through my downs youve accompanied me and 
                    showed me your support and concerns - i hope ive managed to reciprocate that and be there for you as well. <br> You are, and will always be,
                    my ever closest (and probably most versatile) friend ever. You are SUCH a ray of sunshine I feel like i can come
                    to you with absolutely anything and you'll still listen. Like when i first started tranistioning, youre the one i told first.
                    Or when i wanted to skip classes for the first time, although with a negative result, youve been there with me. Youre
                    probably the person that knows me best. Sam, you are the most heartwarming yet somehow
                    the silliest goober ever, and i hope our friendship will only continue in the better direction; forward.
                    <br><br> Love, Noah <3 </p>
